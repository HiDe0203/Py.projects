To check if a year is leap or not, we can use 3 condition 

if year is evenly divisible by 4(it's a leap year) and if the year is evenly divisible by 100 it is a not leap year but if the year is evenly divisible by 400 it is a leap year.

To put it in simpler terms 

if year/4==0(leap year)

if year/4==0 and year/100==0(Not a leap year)

if year/4==0 and year/100!=0(leap year)

if year/400==0(leap year)
